A fork of [Psych Engine](https://github.com/ShadowMario/) based off 0.7.2 Experimental Branch that keeps modding and organization in mind. 

You guys like 0.7.2? Well, I do! Do you hate having to remove all the shit unneeded files? Well, I do too. So I did something about it! I made a Psych Fork that removes and cleans any and all unneeded assets, classes, and files!

## Changes
- Removed unneeded Stage classes
- Deleted any unneeded files/assets
- Repathed folders to keep things organized
- Fixed the slow camera movement in PlayState + MainMenuState
- Added a Customizable FPS/MEM Counter
- Reduced Deprecation Warnings
- Removed unneeded files in Art folder in Root folder
- Toggleable Videos option to reduce folder size

## Installation:
* Inside the root folder is another folder named "setup". If you struggle to compile, just run the .BAT file.
* In addition to what's above, you can run ``haxelib run hmm install`` to do everything the .BAT file can if it happens to not work.
