# Friday Night Funkin' - Psych Engine Organized
A fork of [Psych Engine](https://github.com/ShadowMario/) based off 0.7.2 Experimental Branch that keeps modding and organization in mind. 

## Changes
- Removed unneeded Stage classes
- Deleted any and all unneeded files/assets
- Repathed folders to keep things organized
- Fixed the slow camera movement in PlayState + MainMenuState
- Added a Customizable FPS/MEM Counter

## Installation:
Inside the root folder is another folder named "setup". If you struggle to compile, just run the .BAT file.
